# HPC Playground

I have collected plenty of old and rusty devices
over the years, ranging from crappy laptops
to my old android phones (which never broke, I had to buy
another one just because they were too slow and some apps
were not even supported anymore... sight).
Well, I am the kind of person that will never throw away
old technology, because, you know, I might **need
It one day**. Obviously, I might need an old malfunctioning
router, who knows. I might need that old pentium II laptop
because... well I'll figure it out eventually.
Now that I have a few divices I thought to arrange
a small fleet to of not-really-super computers to
do parallel work, just to have fun.
I kind of want a server to play with and I don't want
to pay long term for hosting on something that is just for fun.

So, this repo contains my playground with those devices.
First I will have to do some networking and install
software on them. I'll use Ansible just because other
people use it. It is a bit overkill for my setup but
It's all good experience. 

I'll set up some virtual machines on my strongest laptop
If 2 gigs of rams per machine will be enough, I still 
have to benchmark.

I want to run some cluster software like SLURM, maybe only
on those better nodes, we'll see. For the os, I have played
with OpenBSD and AlmaLinux which seem to be good choices for
server stuff. On the older laptops I will install netBSD
because It supports a wide veriety of devices.

I'll also document my journey and thoughts here, as a little
developer diary to keep a record.
